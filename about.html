        <h5 id="abouth5">I'm very ambitious and competitive. Success keeps me going, and I want to reach every goal I set, that's what makes me happy and satisfied. My no. 1 goal is to get my first project car and work on it.<hr><br>
            I really like and appreciate Art, it can be paintings/drawings or the art of architecture, especially gothic and victorian architecture.<hr><br>
            In my freetime I play video games, but I would really start learning to dance and draw, sadly I'm too busy for these stuffs right now.<hr><br>
            I have a passion for tattoos, I already got 3 but I'm planning to get more. A lot of people said that after getting your first tattoo, you'll be either terrified of it or you won't be able to stop... Guess which one I am! :DDD
